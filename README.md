# to-do-list

A to do list application that demonstrates my knowledge on React and connecting it to a backend (MongoDB) through API calls. API is deployed [here](https://github.com/ziwei531/rest-to-do-list)

# Key Things I've learned

-   I learned how to create a React app with a backend by installing the necessary packages for both the frontend and backend separately. (Made a mistake by initially assuming they're together in one repository)
-   I learned how to fetch APIs and create my own API, as well as how to handle CRUD operations for both the frontend and backend.
-   I further reinforced my knowledge of React hooks and other concepts, such as useEffect, useState, and props passing.
- I've learned how to use CORS to prevent unauthorized access and also how to provide those who should have access (me!) in accessing the API I've created.
