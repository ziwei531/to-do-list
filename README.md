# to-do-list

In progress to do list app. It will be using MongoDB for backend and React for frontend

# Initial stage

Key Things I've learned

- As this is my first time trying to create a react app with a backend, I learned that I'm supposed to install the necessary packages for both the backend and frontend separately (hence, why you see there's a backend folder but not a frontend folder in this repo). Initially I thought it was to be together, but I've learned it the hard way. I will take note of this in the future
